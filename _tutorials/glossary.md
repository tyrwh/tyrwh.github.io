## IoU
Intersection-over-union. A metric describing the level of overlap between two shapes. It may be stated as a ratio (ranging from 0 to 1) or as a percentage (ranging from 0% to 100%).

The *intersection* is the .

An IoU of 50% is often used as a general .

## mAP
Mean average precision. The apparent redundancy in this term ("Isn't *mean* the same as *average*?") causes some confusion, but this is just due to the fact that many models have multiple classes.

The **average precision (AP)** is the area under the curve of.

If you have a model that purely

## mAP50
Mean average precision at an IoU of 50%. 

## mAP50-95

Mean average precision at a range of IoU thresholds, typically ranging

One thing many people often want to know whether a model is performing well or not. Is an $F1$ of 0.93 good? Is an $mAP_{50-95}$ of 0.78 bad?

# How do you tell if a model is performing well or not?

Many people want to know if their model is good or not. What is a good F1 score? 

Below is a set of quick ways

Are you looking at test set performance?

## Two hashes - look at the confidence curves

The tool you use to train and evaluate the model may spit out curves of P, R, and F1 vs. confidence. Sometimes these are drawn separately, while other times they are drawn as one. If you have multiple classes?

Precision should 


### Three hashes -

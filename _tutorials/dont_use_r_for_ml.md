title: "Why you should not use r or R^2 to gauge model quality"
excerpt: "Foobar snarble"

I can maybe just copy-paste the stuff here from that one email rant I sent out.

*Pearson's correlation coefficient* ($r$) is a very common metric to describe the relationship between two variables, as is the *coefficient of determination* ($R^2$). 

There are very good reasons not to use either of these in evaluating an ML model, however.

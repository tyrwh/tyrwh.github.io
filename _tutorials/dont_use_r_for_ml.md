title: "Why you should not use r or R^2 to gauge model quality"
excerpt: "Foobar snarble"

I can maybe just copy-paste the stuff here from that one email rant I sent out.

*Pearson's correlation coefficient* ($r$) and the related *coefficient of determination* ($R^2$) are very common metrics used to describe the relationship between two variables. 

There are good reasons why these are not commonly used in evaluating an ML model, however.

One pitfall
